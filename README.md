## status:
- vision code functional
- control code not even a thing yet :(

## vision code:
The vision code does two things. 
First, it uses aruco markers placed around the field to find the robots location. 
Then, it finds the location colored golf balls (in my case spray-painted with construction orange paint) relative to the robot.

If someone is interested in using this code, the arrangement of markers can be modified fairly easily by changing the 'markers' array in marker.py
